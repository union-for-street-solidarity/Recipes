| Ingredients | Quantity |
| ----------- | -------- |


### Instructions

1. Fill coffee maker to the fill line with water.
2. Hold the stem together inserted into the basket.
3. Sit the stem while holding the basket together with it into the indentation at the bottom of the coffee maker.
4. Fill the basket with coffee up to the first fill line on the inside of the basket.
5. Shake a light coating of cinnamon over top of the coffee if desired. Slide the lid in place.
6. Make sure the coffee maker is plugged in and turn it on.
7. The coffee maker will begin to make snuffling and slurping sounds. This is normal. After a few minutes, remove the lide and take a peek to make sure steam and hot water are making their way up into the coffee. If so, **golden**. If not, make sure the stem and basket are sitting properly and that there's enough water.
8. Leave it alone for about 50 minutes to about an hour. The liquid indicator on the outside should be dark brown and look a little low when it's done. If it sounds like Curly from the 3 stooges snoring, that's o.k. Something like, "snorrrrrr! woop woop woop woop woop!" That's just our coffee maker's sense of humor and version of "whistle while you work."
9. Listen to music + do something else while you're waiting. I like Andre Segovia.

Then when it's time to fill the jugs - switch music to Astor Piazzola. You have to do this quickly and set up the other pot lickety split to have enough time. Start washing at 7:30 am. Set up the first pot by 8 am, 2nd by 9am, 3rd by 10 am. So you're done by about 11-11:30.

It takes a whole hour to brew so you have to be quick about each fill and re-set up. Fill jug 1. Put on lid. Brew 2nd batch fill jug 2. 3rd batch - give a little more to each jug.
