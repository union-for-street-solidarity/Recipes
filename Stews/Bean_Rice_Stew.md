# Bean & Rice Stew (Vegetarian)

This stew is meant to be very think and nutrient rich. It is very similar to the Chicken stew except that we repalced the Bouillon and Chicken with Vegetable Bouillon and Beans and Rice.

> <b style="color:red">NOTE:</b> This recipe is incomplete. We havent made it with Vegetable Bouillon so idk if the amount is correct. We also plan on using much more rice and less flour next time.

- Yield: ~8 Gallons
- Serves: ~80 people
